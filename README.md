## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

My biggest challenge was selecting the wrong type of app when initially creating the project - I was working with "Multiplatform" instead of iOS. The developer's screen looked different than the walkthrough, and only after joining the Slack support channel was I able to figure out my mistake. After I set up the project correctly I had no issues with completing the project.
