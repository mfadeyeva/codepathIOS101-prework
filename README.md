## App Brainstorming 

**Favorite app 1: Spotify**
 - I enjoy the ability to organize playlists via folders: this makes my Spotify page easier to navigate
 - I also love that Spotify's Home page alerts me about new podcast episodes, artist releases, and concerts: all of the information that I would have sought out online is readily available on one page
   
**Favorite app 2: Pinterest**
- I like the ability to organize images by folder: again, I'm very drawn to the sorting capability
- Pinterest allows users to comment on posts, this introduces and welcomes discussion.

**Favorite app 3: Goodreads**
- I like being able to tag and group books: this allows me to reflect on what genres I'm more interested in and discover similar books
- Goodreads is a social app and makes reading fun by having the option to friend people and follow what they are reading.

**APP PROPOSAL**

CultureConnect is an app for the user interested in literature, music, films, fashion, and beauty. Inspired by the features I love in Goodreads, Pinterest, and Spotify, CultureConnect is a one-stop destination for curated lifestyle exploration and sharing. The app allows users to seamlessly follow friends and influencers, discovering their latest literary favorites, music playlists, fashion inspirations, beauty routines, and film recommendations. Users will be able to post photos of their outfits with embedded links to where one can buy the same pieces, books with links to Goodreads, and beauty product spreads that, again, will have quick links to the appropriate online store. 

## Notes

My biggest challenge was selecting the wrong type of app when initially creating the project - I was working with "Multiplatform" instead of iOS. The developer's screen looked different than the walkthrough, and only after joining the Slack support channel was I able to figure out my mistake. After I set up the project correctly I had no issues with completing the project.
